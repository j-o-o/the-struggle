<h1>Dear Perception</h1>

<p>
„Every object is ultimately equated with a concept: in the object we decipher a class of objects designated by a concept in much the same way that we decipher a meaning in the written word, and are we perhaps not inclined to replace the thing with the perceptual scheme of the thing in the same way that we replace the thing with the word?“ - Rémy Zaugg, „Die List der Unschuld“

Starting from this quotation, the human process of perception becomes the subject of the work. <br>
In order to avoid shock moments caused by stimulus satiation, it tends to simplify the surrounding: Walls, windows, roof equals house.<br> 
The patina, the material, the colour or a strange shadow cast by an object become overlooked trivialities that no longer penetrate our consciousness. <br>
The patterns of perception formed lead to a part of the environment and its wondrous grace simply being overlooked. <br>
The work intends to dissolve the schema in order to allow a new view. <br>

Through the given frame during the act of photography, it removes everyday situations from their context. <br>
They thus become abstract collages, like works of art in a museum, which can stand alone for themselves. <br>
Dear Perception is a letter to the viewer, which is meant to open the eyes for the curious, simple and everyday beauty of the surrounding space.

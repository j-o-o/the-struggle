March 2020. I am standing on a bridge situated at the german-polish border.  <br>
I‘m seeing a friend, but between us is a fence, dividing not only us but two countries.  <br>
Normally we would’ve hung out at the park. 
We laughed, were a bit annoyed, had a smoke, listened to music and observed that we were not the only ones standing in between, as a barrier was built to divide and protect us at the same time.

Blizniak is polish and means Twin, it shares its stem with “blisko“ - which means „near“.  <br>
Blizniak is about the closing and opening of the German-Polish border in Görlitz-Zgorzelec during the COVID-19 Pandemic.  <br>
Both sides stand in stark contrast to each other, nonetheless they belong together.  <br>
People and History on both sides are connected, however the exchange is disrupted by the closing of the border.  <br>
Suddenly the city is limited to one side only. One is left alone, glancing across the river with the notion of beeing exluded.  <br>
The downsides seem obvious: The loneliness of the province and the strong nationalism on both banks of the Neiße-River.  <br>
Whilst coping with  feelings like loneliness and isolation, seeing friends and going for long walks was helpful. <br>
A turning point was when the border reopened, and hundreds of people demonstrated that they didn’t need nor want any border.  <br>
The perspective changed again and the clear frontiers that existed before seemed blurred. Togetherness can be felt again.  <br>

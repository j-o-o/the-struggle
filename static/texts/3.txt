<h1>Alejandra Arevalo - ABSENT, BEFORE HE WAS ACTUALLY GONE</h1>
<p>
During my childhood and part of my adolescence I idealised the figure of a non-existent father. <br>
Through the stories of family members, the figure of an honorable and loving man was built in my head. <br>
I used to imagine how his presence would have changed and influenced stages of my life. <br>
It was as if everyone had agreed to tell the same story, to create a different reality and perhaps to ease his death. <br>
Through the inertia of existence I knew that my father had left us a few months after my mother got pregnant. <br>
Perhaps he was afraid of the challenges that came with forming a second family and with a high-risk pregnancy. <br>
</p>
<p>
This is when the story begins. This project tries to make peace with this event that marks me without even knowing it. <br>
It goes from the imaginary to reality, from life to death, from longing to restlessness.<br>

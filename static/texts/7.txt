<h1>Blue tinted Sisterhood</h1>


<p>
Who or what happenings lead us to the place, where we are now? <br>
The search for the beginning and the question of where we are coming from, as well as the deep connections that keep us grounded, were the starting point of this photo series. <br>
In portraits and blurred memories Blue tinted Sisterhood tells a story about coming of age, and sisters who encourage each other to dream. <br>
</p>
<p>
Trees serve as a place of reminiscence for shared roots and are put into context with fragmentary poems. <br>
Here, water is the pars pro toto of all the places of common growth. <br>
Similar to the Blue Hour marking the border from day to night, the colour blue is the background, on which the contrast — but also the smooth transition — between love and pain is staged. </br>

<h1>Saudade – How much do you miss me?</h1>

<p>
Similar to the German equivalents Heimat, Fernweh or Vorfreude, the term Saudade refers to an emotional state of melancholy and “weltschmerz”. <br>
Almost paradigmatic, the Portuguese word works as a unique tool to communicate intrinsic feelings in a poetic manner. <br>
Nevertheless, the emotional attachment, because of the deeper meaning of this word, makes a universal definition more complicated. <br>
Saudade – How much do you miss me? offers an approach to make this term more tangible, through the medium of photography. <br>
Similar to a diptychon, two images pair as a juxtaposition of yonder and proximity, while past and present are depicted simultaneously. <br>

<p>
Accordingly, the counterpart of the image of a past journey, in this case to Japan, forms the congruence of the current everyday life, whereas the evocation of certain memories through a confrontation with the presence builds upon the factor of resemblance. <br>
For instance, this might emerge through specific forms, colors or lighting conditions. Thus, the core topic of the photographies is the subjective observation of the everyday life concerning the chance, to build a bridge to the yond by means of the recognition of emotional afflicted analogies. <br>
And even though the memory might fade away in the course of time, the immanent longing constantly presents itself as driving force to conserve the momentum for the eternity in various ways.<br>

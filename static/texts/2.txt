<h1>To Forget</h1>
<p>
The picture is facing the wall again. <br>
For a few days I always find the same situation on the bedside table of my grandma. <br>
She explains that there is a stranger staring at her every morning which bothers her. <br>
In the photograph is my grandfather. <br>
She follows me into the kitchen, and I give her the medicine - against thrombosis, high blood pressure and forgetfulness. <br>
My grandma has dementia and my grandpa annoyed. He lives on with his daily routines. For her life become blurred. <br>
She has forgotten the names of her children or how to boil potatoes. <br>
He goes full of energy into the garden to plant salad, the next day he regrets it with backache.<br>

 </p>
 <p>
"The blind chicken is dead," my grandfather said with satisfaction in his voice. <br>
It did not make nice eggs, so it is useless and it just make a lot of work. <br>
While he is talking, I watch Grandma sitting on the sofa, staring into nothing. <br>
</p>
<p>
Grandpa is drawing grandma; she is wearing a dress and has big breasts. <br>
Grandma hesitates for a long time before she paints the contours of a being with trembling strokes, which is supposed to represent grandpa. <br>
I wonder how grandma sees the world and what remains for her. <br>

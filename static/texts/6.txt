<h1>021</h1>
<p>
A visual journey started in the midst of Berlin spring. <br>
Walking through a world of monotone patterns like the cage bars at menagerie des
Plantes.
<p>
On the tile walls of the German Democratic Republic the sunlight plays tag with us. <br>
Strolling between the concrete columns of the WBS70 Buildings.  <br>
My dreams are shrinking together to 120 x 120 dry building panels. <br>
I am taking photographs of my face in the middle of the U-Bahn pit at Ernst-Reuter Platz. <br>
In the absolute Hiatus of the fotofix cabin.
</p>
<p>
To put it on a travel document that won’t go on a journey. <br>
Identity compressed on 35 x 45 mm plastic coated paper. <br>
I am walking the daily cells, a loop of melancholia.  <br>
021 documents my perspective on a time quarantined in the urban labyrinth of Berlin. „Sturm und Drang“ meets boredom. Our infinite playground of globalization seems to be lost.

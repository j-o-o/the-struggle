The shared accommodation for refugees in the Nordstraße of Weimar has been the home of various people for several years. <br>
During a language course program at the end of 2019, I was able to meet some people there and learn more about their personal stories. <br>
Due to the persistent restrictions caused by COVID-19, however, I was no longer able to visit the community inside the residence. <br>
During this situation, I met two people outside who I got to know in the Nordstraße and tried to capture these trips and experiences together. <br>
As so often, the focus should not only be on the refugee biographies and the resulting victimization, but rather on the entanglement of our own stories, narratives and identities. <br>
In addition to changing perspectives, our language barriers also played a role. <br>
During our meetings we dealt with topics such as religion, politics, life in Germany, and repeatedly - conversations about the discriminatory accommodation of refugees and a lack of access to social resources.<br>

The present series primarily captures snapshots from the encounters and tries to contextualize them through further documentary shots from the surroundings.

<h1>Into The Light</h1>

<p>
{Out of the shadows} Queer youth is particularly pressured to conform, either to the norms of the general society or to the stereotypes placed on the LGBTQ+ community. <br>
Nevertheless, we can - and should - rise above the impact this has on us, and use our individuality and diversity to make space for a more open-minded future. <br>
This project aims to use photography as a way to capture the essence of a person and allow glimpses into the life of the young part of the queer community within a contemporary Western European context. <br>
The diversity of the community will be reflected on the surrounding atmosphere as well as the energy the subjects radiate; their preferences about location and style are taken in great consideration in order to improve the understanding of their personality. <br>
In most cases, the pictures are taken following the general rules on composition and lighting, except when it is otherwise needed to better represent the essence of the subject.

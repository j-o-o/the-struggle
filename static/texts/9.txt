<h1>Suriñe Garcia-Pozuelo Iglesias - Into The Light</h1>

<p>
Queer youth is particularly pressured to conform, either to general society or to the stereotypes placed on the LGBTQ+ community. 
</p>
<p>
The medium of photography can be used to capture the essence of a person in a concrete moment; this project aims to use it to allow glimpses into the 
life of the young part of the queer community within the contemporary Western European context, presenting the variety and diversity of queer individuals and 
sub-groups, and also the impact that the community has on the individual and vice versa. 
</p>
<p>
This variety and diversity will be reflected through the use of different techniques and media. 
Each subject will be shown in a way that allows the viewer to perceive the surrounding atmosphere as well as the energy they radiate. 
</p>
<p>
The subject's preferences about location and style are taken in great consideration in order to improve the understanding of their personality; 
in most cases, the pictures are taken following the general rules on composition and lighting, except when it is otherwise needed to better show the essence of the subject.

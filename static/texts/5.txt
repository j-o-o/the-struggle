<h1>In Between</h1>
<p>
The series „in-between“ shows how an individual deals with a pandemic. <br>
The pictures are used to illustrate emotional and mental states, the stages that have been passed through and reflected during this situation. <br>
The feeling of being „in-between“ was caused by the occurrence of unexpected events, the resulting postponement of plans and the resulting stoppage. <br>
The photographs are object-centered. <br>
They play with the abstract and show the confrontation with loneliness, loss of connection, boredom, anger, missing, fear and dependence on others. <br>
The first part documents the emotional states during the time of „self quarantining“, of being inside. <br>
The photographs, which refer to the time „after“, i.e. the lifting of the initial restriction and the return to the supposed „normality“-and the associated feeling of being lost, form the second part of the examination.

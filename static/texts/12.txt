<h1>Bei uns zu haus ist es langweilig</h1>
<p>
While other kids had cute nicknames like “Hase” or “Schnecke”, my dad lovingly called me “Mehlsack” which means in german language flour sack. <br>
I remember the time the phone rang, lunch was about to burn and a customer asked for the boss, my mom often shouted “Bei uns zu Hause ist es langweilig!”. <br>
Which means “At our house it is boring!”. This ironic sentence became part of our family history long before I was born but its true until today.<br>

<p>
My parents always met the challenge of being self-employed while meeting the demands of providing for a normal family life.<br>
</p>
<p>
Their decision in 1995 to take over my dad’s parents bakery was a huge step and the beginning of a lot of responsibility. When the workplace is only 2 floors below, it is impossible to separate it from your private life. 
Which results in privileges as well as in restrictions which are hard to understand, especially for outsiders.<br>
The clock around here ticks differently.  2:30 a.m. is a common time to get up;  and lights go out at 9 p.m. on a Friday night, while others start their weekend. 
During my childhood and my teenage years it was hard for me to accept that we are different then other families. <br>
I got mad and saw my home as a place of tasks and commitments.<br>
Today I learned to love and value my home. I admire my parents for their discipline and their power, they gave their whole lives for the sake of the bakery and they love their job no matter what.

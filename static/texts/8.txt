<h1>Dystopia in real life</h1>
<p>
You were so heavy on me and you knew you were always stronger than me. <br>
You took advantage of it and of me at the same time. It was unwanted, unbearable. <br>
You were heavy. You still are to this day. <br>
</p>
<p>
Inside me, on me, around me. You stick to me like a second skin. I feel dirty. <br>
Remember when you crushed me with your hands and mouth like you crushed a flower in your hands? Can you live with that thought? <br>
Because it's hard for me. But you know I can let other bodies touch me and it feels good. <br>
I get goose bumps when he caresses me And when he lays his hands on me, I don't have a shred of worry. <br>
I see beauty in two people touching each other
